# svg-webapp

To run, run the command

```
python app.py
```

In the test-images folder there are pngs that the model has not seen.

Note in requirments.txt I change tensorflow-macos to tensorflow-cpu for compatability with Heroku. 

There are some unrelated files for attempting to deploy on Heroku.
